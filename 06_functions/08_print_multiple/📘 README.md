# Message Repeater 🔁

This Python program lets you type a message and choose how many times you want it printed.

## 🚀 How It Works

- The user is asked for a message to repeat.
- Then, the user specifies how many times to print it.
- If an invalid number is entered, it asks again.
- Pressing **Enter** without typing a message will **exit** the program.

## ✅ Example Output

Enter Your Message: Hello World 

How Many Times You Want To Repeat: 3 

Hello World
Hello World 
Hello World 

Enter Your Message: Python Rocks 

How Many Times You Want To Repeat: 2 

Python Rocks Python Rocks

Enter Your Message: (Program exits)


## ▶️ How to Run

1. Save the file as `message_repeater.py`.
2. Run it:

```bash
python message_repeater.py
```
## 💡 Key Concepts
For Loop: To repeat the message.

Input Validation: try-except to handle wrong entries.

Infinite Loop (while True): To allow multiple entries without restarting the program.
