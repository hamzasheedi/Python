# Double Number Program

This is a simple Python script that doubles the number entered by the user.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Prompts the user to input a number.
2. Multiplies the number by 2.
3. Displays the result using an f-string.

## ✅ Example

Enter Your Number To Double: 7

Double that is 14


## 💡 Features

- Handles invalid input using try-except.
- Clean function separation: input logic in `main()` and math logic in `double()`.

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Save the file as `double_number.py`.
2. Run the script:

```bash
python double_number.py
```

## 🔁 Bonus Idea

Add a loop to allow multiple inputs until the user types "exit"!
