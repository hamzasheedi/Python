# Even Number Checker

A simple Python script that collects numbers from the user and displays only the even ones.

## ğŸš€ How It Works

1. The program repeatedly asks the user to enter integers.
2. When the user presses Enter (empty input), the loop stops.
3. The script then prints all even numbers from the entered list.
