# Even Number Checker

A simple Python script that collects numbers from the user and displays only the even ones.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The program repeatedly asks the user to enter integers.
2. When the user presses Enter (empty input), the loop stops.
3. The script then prints all even numbers from the entered list.

## 📦 Example Run

Enter an integer (or press Enter to stop): 12 

Enter an integer (or press Enter to stop): 7 

Enter an integer (or press Enter to stop): 0 

Enter an integer (or press Enter to stop): 15 

Enter an integer (or press Enter to stop): 8 

Enter an integer (or press Enter to stop):

Your Numbers: [12, 7, 0, 15, 8]

Even Numbers: 12 0 8


## ✅ Concepts Used

- Lists and data storage
- Infinite loops (`while True`)
- Try/except for input validation
- Modulo operator to check even numbers

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Save the script as `even_number_checker.py`.
2. Run it using Python


## Bonus Idea
Want to display odd numbers too? Just modify check_even() to also print odd ones with a small condition tweak!
