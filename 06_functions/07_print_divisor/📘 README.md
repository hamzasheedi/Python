# Divisor Printer 📤

This program prints all the divisors of a given number entered by the user.

## 🚀 How It Works

- The user is asked to input a number.
- The program calculates and prints all numbers that divide the input without a remainder.
- If the input is not an integer, it shows an error and stops the program.

## ✅ Example Output

Enter Your Number To Print Divisors: 12 1 2 3 4 6 12 Enter Your Number To Print Divisors: 15 1 3 5 15 Enter Your Number To Print Divisors: abc Input Only Integers


## ▶️ How to Run

1. Save the file as `divisor_printer.py`.
2. Run it:

```bash
python divisor_printer.py
```

## 💡 Key Concepts
Modulus Operator %: To check divisibility.

For Loop: To iterate through numbers.

Try-Except: To handle non-integer inputs gracefully.

Infinite Loop (while True): For continuous input until an invalid entry.
