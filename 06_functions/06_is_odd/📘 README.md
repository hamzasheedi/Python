# Even and Odd Checker 🔢

This Python program checks whether numbers from 0 to 10 are even or odd.

## 🚀 How It Works

- The program defines two functions:
  - `is_even(value)`: Checks and prints if a number is even.
  - `is_odd(value)`: Checks and prints if a number is odd.
- The `main()` function loops through numbers from 0 to 10 and calls both checking functions.

## ✅ Example Output

0 is Even! 1 is Odd! 

2 is Even! 3 is Odd!

4 is Even! 5 is Odd! 

6 is Even! 7 is Odd! 

8 is Even! 

9 is Odd! 10 is Even!



## ▶️ How to Run

1. Save the file as `even_odd_checker.py`.
2. Run it:

```bash
python even_odd_checker.py
```

## 💡 Key Concepts
