# Chaotic Counter

A fun Python script that counts from 1 to 10 â€” but there's a random chance it stops early!

---

## How It Works

- The program starts counting from 1 to 10.
- On each number, there's a 30% chance the program will "feel like stopping" and exit early.
- Uses Python's `random` module to simulate unpredictability.

## Sample Output

ðŸ¤– I'm going to count up to 10 â€” unless I randomly decide to stop early!

Counting: 1

Counting: 2

ðŸ˜… Suddenly felt like stopping... âœ… I'm done!
