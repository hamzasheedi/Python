# Chaotic Counter

A fun Python script that counts from 1 to 10 â€” but there's a random chance it stops early!

## How It Works

- The program starts counting from 1 to 10.
- On each number, there's a 30% chance the program will "feel like stopping" and exit early.
- Uses Python's `random` module to simulate unpredictability.
