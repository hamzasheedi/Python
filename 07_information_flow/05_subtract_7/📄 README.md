# Subtract 7 Program

This is a simple Python program that takes an integer input from the user and subtracts 7 from it. It's designed as a beginner-friendly exercise to demonstrate basic function usage, arithmetic operations, and error handling.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter an integer.
2. It passes the number to a function called `subtract_7`.
3. The function subtracts 7 from the input and prints the result.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- Function definition and calling
- User input handling with `input()`
- Basic arithmetic operations (`-`)
- Error handling using `try` and `except`
- Clean code structure using `main()` and `if __name__ == '__main__':`

Enter your number: 10
Result after subtracting 7: 3
```

If the user enters something invalid:

Enter your number: hello

❌ Please enter a valid integer.
