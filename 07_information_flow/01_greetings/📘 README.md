# 👋 Greeting Program

A simple Python script that asks the user for their name and prints a personalized greeting.

## ✅ Example

What is your name? : Hamza 

Greetings Hamza!

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- **Functions**: `greet(name)` prints a message using the name
- **String Formatting**: Uses f-strings to insert a name in the output
- **User Input**: Reads name from the console using `input()`
- **Main Function**: Organizes code using `main()` and `if __name__ == '__main__'`

## ▶️ How to Run

Save the script as `greet.py` and run it in a terminal using:

```bash
python greet.py
