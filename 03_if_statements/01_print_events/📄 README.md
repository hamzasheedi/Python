# üîÅ Even Numbers with Python Loops

This script demonstrates **four different ways** to print even numbers from 0 to 20 using Python loops.

---

## üîç Loop Styles

### 1. While Loop
Increments by 2 in each iteration.

### 2. For Loop with `range()`
Uses a step of 2 to directly get even numbers.

### 3. Conditional While Loop
Implements a more complex structure using `if` and `break`.

### 4. Multiplication Method
Multiplies numbers from 1 to 10 by 2 to get evens.
