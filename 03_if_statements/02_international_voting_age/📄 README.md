# 🗳️ Voting Validation Script

This Python program checks where you're eligible to vote based on your age across three fictional countries:

- **Peturksbouipo** – voting age: 16+
- **Stanlau** – voting age: 25+
- **Mayengua** – voting age: 48+

---

## 💡 How It Works

1. User enters their age.
2. The script compares it with the voting age limits.
3. It prints which places you're allowed to vote.

## ✅ Example Outputs
