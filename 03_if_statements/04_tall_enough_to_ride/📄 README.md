# 🎢 Ride Height Checker

A fun little program to check if you're tall enough to go on a ride at the amusement park!

---

## ✅ How It Works

- Prompts the user to enter their height in centimeters.
- If height is **100 cm or more** → Allowed to ride.
- If less than 100 cm → Not allowed (but encouraged for next year!).
- Handles non-numeric and empty input safely.

## 💡 Example


📏 Enter your height in cm (or press Enter to quit): 105 ✅ You're tall enough to ride!

📏 Enter your height in cm (or press Enter to quit): 80 ❌ You're not tall enough to ride. Maybe next year!
