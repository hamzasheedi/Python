## 💡 What is the Fibonacci Sequence?

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.  
It starts from `0` and `1` like this:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...

---

## ✅ How It Works

- Starts with `a = 0` and `b = 1`
- For each term, print `a`, and then update `a` and `b` like this:
  ```python
  a, b = b, a + b

---

## 🧪 Example Output
If you call:

fibonacci(10)

You'll get:

```bash
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
```
