# 🔁 Double Until 100

This script asks the user to enter a number and repeatedly doubles it until the value becomes greater than or equal to 100.

## 📋 How It Works

- Accepts a number from the user.
- Doubles the number in each iteration.
- Stops when the number is `>= 100`.

## 🧾 Sample Run

Enter Your Number: 5
Current Value: 10
Current Value: 20
Current Value: 40
Current Value: 80
Current Value: 160
Done! Value has reached or exceeded 100.
