# 🎮 Guess the Number Game

A simple Python game where the computer randomly selects a number between 0 and 99, and you have to guess it!

## 🚀 How to Play

1. Run the script.
2. The computer will think of a number between 0 and 99.
3. You try to guess the number.
4. The program will tell you if your guess is:
   - Too high
   - Too low
   - Or correct!

## 🧠 Features Demonstrated

- Using `random.randint()`
- `while` loop for repeated guessing
- `try-except` for input validation
- Checking input bounds
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)

## 🖥️ Run it in Terminal

```bash
python 00_guess_my_number.py
