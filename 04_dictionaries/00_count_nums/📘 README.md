# Duplicate Counter

This Python script allows the user to input a list of numbers and identifies any repeated entries. For each duplicate entry, it shows how many times it has appeared so far.

## 📌 How It Works

1. The program continuously prompts the user to enter a number.
2. The user can press Enter without typing anything to stop input.
3. The script checks each new number:
   - If it's new, it adds it to a unique list and starts counting.
   - If it's already been added, it updates and prints the count.

## 💡 Example

Enter a number: 5
Enter a number: 3
Enter a number: 5
5 appears 2 times
Enter a number: 3
3 appears 2 times
Enter a number:
